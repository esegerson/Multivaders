# Multivaders!

This is a quick little game to help students memorize multiplication facts, like `3 Ã— 2 = 6`.  Multiplication problems (called "vaders" in code, like little space invaders) float down the screen. The player must solve the problems by typing in the correct answer. Solving a problem makes the problem vanish and the player is onto another problem. If a problem hits the bottom of the screen, the game is over.

On the title screen, players can select what individual problems they want to work on or they can choose five presets.

A song is played while playing. Tones are played when the player types a number. There is some code to play a tone that harmonizes with the song, but it's a little off and needs work.

The game is built entirely in HTML, JavaScript, and CSS.
