# Multivaders!

This is a quick little game to help students memorize multiplication facts, like `3 Ã— 2 = 6`.  Multiplication problems (called "vaders" in code, like little space invaders) float down the screen. 

## Title Screen

On the title screen, players can select what individual problems they want to work on or they can choose five presets.

## Basic rules and Gameplay

The player must solve the problems by typing in the correct answer. Solving a problem makes the problem vanish and the player is onto another problem. As the problems approach the bottom of the screen, the screen starts to turn red. If a problem hits the bottom of the screen, the game is over. If the player enters the wrong answer, the speed of the problem is tripled (cumulative), making it rush toward the bottom of the screen. Spacebar pauses the game. Escape ends the game. Backspace erases what was written. Tilde reveals some debugger stats. Left and right arrows let the player choose a different problem.

## Technicals

### Music

A song is played while playing. Tones are synthesized when the player types a number. Code plays a tone that harmonizes with the song.

### Difficulty Progression

I want the game to get harder as the player progresses, to keep it "fun" and to try to achieve a higher score.  There are two ways to make the game harder over time:  how often a new problem appears (delay) and how fast the problem drops down the screen (speed). My goal is to make a score of 100 fairly difficult with a game-over soon after that. In the future, I'd like to build in a mechanism that will grant the player occasional reprieves ([see Jesse Schell's "Art of Game Design"](https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/a/110869)). Maybe a periodic explosive problem that destroys all the problems around it or a temporary way to multi-shot.

### Languages/Technology

The game is built entirely in HTML, JavaScript, and CSS.

## TODO / Wishlist

- Add a progressive saw-like difficulty ladder
    - Perhaps exploding problems that take out neighbors, providing a reprieve
    - Perhaps a temporary power-up that solves all identical problems on-screen (multi-solving)
- Improve the inevitable game-over experience; the game-over screen is basic, and currently the problems on-screen turn black when I feel like they should continue to bombard the bottom of the screen for 5 seconds
- Use local storage so players can make their own presets
- Use local storage to save high scores (with old-school initials?)
- Improve how left and right arrows choose different problems.  Currently it just looks at horizontal position, but I'd like to take into account the vertical position, too.  If there's a problem near the bottom of the screen to the right, I'd like the right-arrow to select that one over the one right next to the active problem that's at the top of the screen.
    - Maybe use the mouse like a left-right paddle to select?
- More sound effects:
    - Wrong answer "buzz"
    - Correct answer "zap"
    - Backspace "click"
    - Game over "groan" or explosion
- Move graphics code from game.js to separate graphics.js file
- Move the turret around as it targets different problems
    - Make the turret stand out more?
- Add a fullscreen toggle button
- To prevent overlapping and legibility, darken problems that are behind the active problem; restore them when the active problem is solved

## Known Bugs

- Does not work on mobile: no on-screen keyboard; cannot hover over presets
- Does not scale to different resolutions well - larger resolutions are easier because the problems take longer to fall
